# PacMen-Factory

## Description
A simple game to generate PacMen images with the click of a button and have them randomly navigate the browser window at their own pace and direction. 
A fun way to learn how to use JavaScript to dynamically display data on a web page utilizing array methods and manipulating the DOM.

## How to Run
Load the HTML file into a webpage. Click the button to Create a PacMan to add another PacMan to the game at any time. Click Start Game to watch the PacMen navigate across the webpage like the classic game. 

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
Future iterations will add CSS styling to improve visual layout of the page and buttons to stop the game or remove PacMen.
